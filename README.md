## Motivation 
In the dynamic realm of professional basketball, the pursuit of playoff contention stands as a defining objective for NBA teams. I explored the intricate features and patterns that influence a team's likelihood of clinching a coveted playoff spot. Beyond the conventional wisdom surrounding player performance metrics and team statistics, I delved into the realm of machine learning classification models to discern the crucial factors that distinguish playoff-bound teams from their counterparts. This project not only seeks to validate established notions but also aims to uncover nuanced insights, providing a data-driven lens through which one can assess and predict the playoff potential of NBA teams. Through the fusion of statistical analysis and machine learning, the project endeavors to contribute valuable perspectives for basketball enthusiasts, analysts, and team strategists alike, shedding light on the pivotal elements that propel teams towards the pinnacle of NBA success – a spot in the highly competitive playoff bracket.


## Dataset
**Source:** Data is gathered from https://www.basketball-reference.com/
**Period:** From 1984 to 2020
**Features:** Total 23 columns and 566 rows  


## Limitations
Dataset does not include other features that might be important for performance of a team such as Team mentality, number of players who are injured, whether a team has all-star level players or not, tatics, etc… Therefore, there might be other important features that have a positive relationship with getting into the playoffs.
